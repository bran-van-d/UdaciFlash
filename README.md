# UdaciFlash

This *ANDROID* project allows a user to create decks of flash cards. Opening to a deck view with a few starter decks, the user has the option to create a new deck, add cards to new and existing decks and then take quizzes on their creations. The quiz itself allows the user the select if they got it right or wrong, so it's an application that expects a bit of honesty ;).

Users can also delete decks they no longer need.
